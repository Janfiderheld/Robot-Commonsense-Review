abstract={With the practical demands in flexible and adaptive robot manipulation skills in various environment settings, there are more challenges to be tackled to enable the robot with valid responsive behaviors in task handling. This paper discuss on the methods to achieve agile robot manipulations tasks with the advantages from human-robot teleoperation, robot perception, knowledge-based robot programming, robot motion planning and robot skill learning. Teleoperation serves as a typical Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) manner to allow the human user to guide the robot behavior in a direct manner. Robot automation, including the sensor perception (object detection, pose estimation etc.), motion planning and motion control that can handle well defined problems, but is also lack of general sense of understanding capability and not good at solving not fully defined task challenges. An agile robotic system should have a knowledge database which defines the skill sets required for the robot to handle various robot tasks. Meanwhile, the system should be able to take human assistance inputs through HRI when the robot is stuck. Moreover, the system should be able to pick up new skill set with each human knowledge input. Methodology discussion is the main scope of the paper, and preliminary experiments on telemanipulation with UR5 robot are demonstrated to show the flexible robot guidance through HRI inputs. Future work will aim to add in perception, motion planning, and picking up skill modules to come up with a more agile solution in handling variation of tasks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This survey reviews recent researches conducted on the application of fuzzy approaches to Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) dealing with real-time applications. Fuzzy approaches have been effectively applied for knowledge representation, feature selection, and learning in CBR. Dealing with imprecise and uncertain knowledge, generalization, mining, and learning also in combination with low computational complexity are the main advantages of fuzzy approaches used in the CBR context. This paper presents and summarizes new findings on the integration of fuzzy approaches with CBR. The survey results highlight the advantages of fuzzy approaches in CBR for real-time applications. They show the current state of fuzzy-based CBR approaches. In addition, fuzzy approaches which are more operative for each operation in CBR are addressed. Those operations most contributing to the advantages of the fuzzy approach will be pointed out and detailed. Low accuracy, storage and computational challenges with a large amount of experiences and uncertainties are important issues in case of real-time applications. This paper proposes a general fuzzy-based CBR approach for real-time applications to benefit the advantages of previous approaches. Finally, some considerations of latest developments in fuzzy approaches which may be introduced as potential research directions for real-time applications are stated. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={We present a new knowledge-based robot architecture that relies on ontologies and logical programming to represent robot behavior in a declarative fashion. Most state-of-theart robot architectures, instead, build on very detailed procedural descriptions of robot behavior which are created at design time and typically do not generalize well across new situations. A declarative approach that produces actual robot behavior as a result of reasoning instead can produce many different behaviors that are adapted to the particular context and situation without having to model all influencing factors at design time. Further, this approach allows to add further knowledge or further primitives in a modular fashion. This simplifies the design of complex systems as the behaviour needs to be described at a higher-level of abstraction instead of by very detailed and specific procedures. The actual behaviour is then generated at runtime as a result of interpretation of logical programs. In our architecture we rely on Prolog to represent action knowledge, on (Horn) rules to represent actions and on Prolog resolution to infer execution plans at runtime. In this paper we present a first version of our architecture. As proof-of-concept we demonstrate how to apply it to generate pick-and-place behavior in a simulated environment. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={This work proposes a conceptual model of personal space that can be used within symbolic knowledge-based robot architectures. The robot represents personal spaces in terms of affordance spaces attached to humans, i.e., portions of physical space that can be used for interactions. The model does not rely on numeric functions nor does it impose any restrictions upon the geometry of personal space. The approach is applied to human-aware robot activity placement planning: Given an activity type and a robot that is to perform an activity of this type, principles of personal space use determine the reasons pros and cons to place that particular activity at a particular affordance space. The symbolic representations of personal spaces enable robots to make choices and to communicate the reasons for their choices to humans. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={During the last 50 years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) made colossal progress.Beginning from the simple heuristic search in space now complicated methods of patternrecognition, planning, control and learning are developed. It seems that we are movingtowards the creation of AI control system with a high degree of autonomy. Such systemsare capable of efficient operation in unpredictable varying and hostile environment,including conflict situations. More and more practitioners in engineering will be involvedin the process of AI control systems development. Unfortunately only the small part ofup-to-date AI methods and algorithms are applicable to this task. The aim of this article isto list AI directions which, in author's opinion, are suitable for AI control systemdevelopment. We will consider the control systems of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).Such vehicles are characterized by the high dynamics and complicated system ofrestrictions on control parameters. Nevertheless, the main statements of this paper areapplicable to control systems of other mobile objects based on AI principles. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Looking at exhaust-gas after-treatment systems in its entirety leads to further improvement of emission control devices and to the accomplishment of future challenges such as lower legislative emission limits, new fuels, and more efficient engine concepts. This article provides an overview on the state-of-the art mobile exhaust-gas after-treatment devices. Current and future challenges are discussed in the light of present approaches such as hierarchical modeling reaching from DFT computations of molecular processes to CFD simulation of entire lines of exhaust-gas cleaning devices, close-to-reality emission control test benches and aging procedures, on-board diagnostics, and catalyst characterization at operating conditions and preferentially all length scales. In future, knowledge-based robot-controlled preparation and dynamic models coupled with information from real operation will significantly support research and development. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
