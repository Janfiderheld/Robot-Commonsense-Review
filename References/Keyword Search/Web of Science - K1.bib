Abstract = {Exhaust Gas Aftertreatment in Mobile Systems: Status, Challenges, and
   Perspectives Looking at exhaust-gas after-treatment systems in its
   entirety leads to further improvement of emission control devices and to
   the accomplishment of future challenges such as lower legislative
   emission limits, new fuels, and more efficient engine concepts. This
   article provides an overview on the state-of-the art mobile exhaust-gas
   after-treatment devices. Current and future challenges are discussed in
   the light of present approaches such as hierarchical modeling reaching
   from DFT computations of molecular processes to CFD simulation of entire
   lines of exhaust-gas cleaning devices, close-to-reality emission control
   test benches and aging procedures, on-board diagnostics, and catalyst
   characterization at operating conditions and preferentially all length
   scales. In future, knowledge-based robot-controlled preparation and
   dynamic models coupled with information from real operation will
   significantly support research and development.},
