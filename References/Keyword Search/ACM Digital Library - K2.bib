abstract = {Sports have evolved from the exposition of athletes’ pure talent to an industry that generates jobs and entertainment. In the Philippines, athletes from different Universities and Colleges are the primary source of talents in amateur and professional leagues especially in the field of volleyball and basketball. As such, schools are developing their physical and athletic programs to establish their respective competitive advantage. However, student-athletes from universities with insufficient resources are often neglected due to inadequate exposure. Furthermore, there is no framework that secures the statistical data of student-athletes which can be used for future appraisal of player's talent and athletic skills. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of “Sports Ed 3.5” for universities and collegiate athletic associations to develop an athlete information system for sports analytics. In addition, the framework aims to define the philosophy that will govern all the stakeholders in the utilization of an athlete's information for flexible decision-making. Players’ dataset from the Philippine Basketball Association's website was retrieved to demonstrate on how an athletic information system can support the athletes, coaches, and stakeholders of sports. Supervised algorithms were used to illustrate the value of data and machine learning models in athletic development programs. Future research direction and challenges are discussed to implement the proposed “Sports Ed 3.5” model for Philippine schools and universities.},

abstract = {Lexical simplification (LS) aims at replacing complex words with simpler alternatives. LS commonly consists of three main steps: complex word identification, substitute generation, and substitute ranking. Existing LS methods focus on the contextual information of the complex word in the last step (substitute ranking). However, they miss out the following two facts: (1) The word complexity of a polysemous word is very closely related to its context; (2) The step of substitute generation regardless of the context will inevitably produce a large number of spurious candidates. Therefore, we propose a novel LS system LSBert based on pretrained language model BERT to address the aforementioned issues, which is capable of making use of the wider context when both identifying the words in need of simplification and generating substitute candidates for the complex words.Specifically, LSBert consists of a network for complex word identification by fine-tuning BERT and a network for substitute generation based on BERT. Experimental results show that LSBert performs well in both complex word identification and substitute generation, achieving state-of-the-art results in three benchmarks. To facilitate reproducibility, the code of the LSBert system is available at <uri>https://github.com/qiang2100/BERT-LS</uri>.},
