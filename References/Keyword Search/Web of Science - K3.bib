Abstract = {Reminiscence is a lifelong activity that happens throughout our
   lifespan. While memories can serve as topics in people's everyday
   conversations, recalling the past can also help us build self-esteem and
   increase our level of happiness. In this paper, we aim to develop a
   robot companion that helps people to recollect their memories from
   personal photographs. We focus on how a robot can associate concepts
   relevant to the content in the photographs and evoke people's memories
   by asking questions that are both relatable and engaging. To understand
   the content of a picture, we applied deep learning techniques in order
   to recognize events, objects, and scenes in it. Then, these observations
   and any user utterances are considered in a Markov random field
   (MRF)-based algorithm that contains common sense knowledge of a number
   of events, with loopy belief propagation being used to infer possible
   associated concepts and topics. Afterward, the robot poses appropriate
   questions about the selected topics, guiding the user to reminisce
   through conversation. Our results show that the proposed system can pose
   related and appropriate questions to interact with the user, and has the
   potential guide the user to recall the past in an organized way.},

Title = {Efficient Dynamic Object Search in Home Environment by Mobile Robot: <

Abstract = {The capability of object search is a prerequisite for mobile robot to
   perform everyday tasks in the home environment. Due to the dynamic
   nature of object and the particularity of home environment, it still
   remains a challenging problem for mobile robot to find the dynamic
   target object with the low total cost. To address this problem, a priori
   knowledge-based approach for dynamic object search is presented in this
   paper. Inspired by human search process, the common sense knowledge
   about typical spatial location and the relationship between objects is
   modeled as a priori knowledge. On this basis, we propose a novel search
   strategy to improve the search efficiency of mobile robot at the scale
   of the entire home environment. Unlike the existing methods, a trade-off
   between the inferred spatial location knowledge and the distance of
   robot position and candidate room is considered, which permits robot to
   prioritize the search effort for the candidate room in which the target
   object is most likely to be found. Also, the search space inside the
   room is further reduced by using a priori knowledge-guided search
   heuristics. Meanwhile, the update of knowledge is also investigated to
   maintain its reliability. The proposed approach is implemented in both
   simulation and real environments, and evaluated through extensive
   experiments. The experimental results are provided to demonstrate the
   feasibility and efficiency of our proposal.},

Title = {Learning Actions to Improve the Perceptual Anchoring of Objects},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine how to ground symbols referring to objects in
   perceptual data from a robot system by examining object entities and
   their changes over time. In particular, we approach the challenge by (1)
   tracking and maintaining object entities over time; and (2) utilizing an
   artificial neural network to learn the coupling between words referring
   to actions and movement patterns of tracked object entities. For this
   purpose, we propose a framework that relies on the notations presented
   in perceptual anchoring. We further present a practical extension of the
   notation such that our framework can track and maintain the history of
   detected object entities. Our approach is evaluated using everyday
   objects typically found in a home environment. Our object classification
   module has the possibility to detect and classify over several 100
   object categories. We demonstrate how the framework creates and
   maintains, both in space and time, representations of objects such as
   spoon and coffee mug. These representations are later used for training
   of different sequential learning algorithms to learn movement actions
   such as pour and stir. We finally exemplify how learned movements
   actions, combined with commonsense knowledge, further can be used to
   improve the anchoring process per se.},
