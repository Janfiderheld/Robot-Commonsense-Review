abstract = {In order to achieve a human-like skill level in manipulation, autonomous robots that perform everyday manipulation tasks require perception capabilities that go beyond recognition delivered by single perception algorithms. In previous work we have presented RoboSherlock, an ensemble-based, knowledge driven robotic perception system and OpenEase an online framework for knowledge representation and reasoning. We propose to demonstrate, by combining these two frameworks, how knowledge processing can boosts the perception capabilities of a robotic agent performing household chores.},

abstract = {Generating qualitative responses has always been a challenge for human-computer dialogue systems. Existing dialogue systems generally derive from either retrieval-based or generative-based approaches, both of which have their own pros and cons. Despite the natural idea of an ensemble model of the two, existing ensemble methods only focused on leveraging one approach to enhance another, we argue however that they can be further mutually enhanced with a proper training strategy. In this paper, we propose ensembleGAN, an adversarial learning framework for enhancing a retrieval-generation ensemble model in open-domain conversation scenario. It consists of a language-model-like generator, a ranker generator, and one ranker discriminator. Aiming at generating responses that approximate the ground-truth and receive high ranking scores from the discriminator, the two generators learn to generate improved highly relevant responses and competitive unobserved candidates respectively, while the discriminative ranker is trained to identify true responses from adversarial ones, thus featuring the merits of both generator counterparts. The experimental results on a large short-text conversation data demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensembleGAN by the amelioration on both human and automatic evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Discovery of World Wide Web data is slightly affected due to natural-language text presentation in the internet. Moreover, exponential growth of users' requirement and expectation makes the matter more critical. Coping with the overstated problem, research and development on the Semantic Web and Semantic Web search engine are actively conducted. The concept of ontology is established in the searching process. In this paper, LexOn Search is introduced using WordNet as a lexical ontology to presents clustering concept in order to utilized searching time. LexOn search engine is built by integrating WordNet, Apache Solr and Semantic Information Retrieval Engine (SIREn). We test the LexOn search with SIREn and it shows LexOn improved the searching time. The preliminary experimental results have given interesting results in terms of data arrangement and time usage.},

abstract = {The availability of sensor technology in home and building automation offers new opportunities for AI applications. Machine learning (ML) methods can recognize device patterns and profiles based on sensor data and make energy-relevant predictions. At a higher level, the detected patterns can in turn be used to learn activity patterns. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to augment ML-based outputs with inductive logic-based learning techniques. We present evaluation results and illustrate an application to agent-supported critical situation detection in the assisted living domain.},
