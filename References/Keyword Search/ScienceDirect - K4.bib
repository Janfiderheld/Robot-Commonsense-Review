abstract = {This paper presents the semantic-reasoning module of VIRBOT, our proposed architecture for service robots. We show that by combining symbolic AI with digital-signal processing techniques this module achieves competitive performance. Our system translates a voice command into an unambiguous representation that helps an inference engine, built around an expert system, to perform action and motion planning. First, in the natural-language interpretation process, the system generates two outputs: (1) conceptual dependence, expressing the linguistic meaning of the statement, and (2) verbal confirmation, a paraphrase in natural language that is repeated to the user to confirm that the command has been correctly understood. Then, a conceptual-dependency interpreter extracts semantic role structures from the input sentence and looks for such structures in a set of known interpretation patterns. We evaluate this approach in a series of skill-specific semantic-reasoning experiments. Finally, we demonstrate our system in the general-purpose service robot test of the RoboCup-at-Home international competition, where incomplete information is given to a robot and the robot must recognize and request the missing information, and we compare our results with a series of baselines from the competition where our proposal performed best.}

abstract = {Human–Robot Interaction challenges Artificial Intelligence in many regards: dynamic, partially unknown environments that were not originally designed for robots; a broad variety of situations with rich semantics to understand and interpret; physical interactions with humans that requires fine, low-latency yet socially acceptable control strategies; natural and multi-modal communication which mandates common-sense knowledge and the representation of possibly divergent mental models. This article is an attempt to characterise these challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks with a human. We identify first the needed individual and collaborative cognitive skills: geometric reasoning and situation assessment based on perspective-taking and affordance analysis; acquisition and representation of knowledge models for multiple agents (humans and robots, with their specificities); situated, natural and multi-modal dialogue; human-aware task planning; human–robot joint task achievement. The article discusses each of these abilities, presents working implementations, and shows how they combine in a coherent and original deliberative architecture for human–robot interaction. Supported by experimental results, we eventually show how explicit knowledge management, both symbolic and geometric, proves to be instrumental to richer and more natural human–robot interactions by pushing for pervasive, human-level semantics within the robot's deliberative system.}

abstract = {Future service robots targeted to operate in domestic or industrial environment and in close collaboration with humans should possess the ability to produce meaningful internal perceptual representations of their own surroundings, enabling them to fulfill a variety of real-world tasks. For this purpose, we present here a semantic mapping framework featuring geometrical and semasiological attributes that reveal the relationships between objects and places in a real-life environment. The geometrical component consists of a 3D metric map, onto which a topological map is deployed. The semasiological part is realized by putting together a place recognition algorithm and an object recognition one. The categorization of the different places relies on the resolution of appearance-based consistency histograms, while for the recognition of objects in the scene, a hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) network boosted by a saliency attentional model, is utilized. These semantic attributes are then deposited on the topological map to augment it with the belief distributions regarding the visited places, enabling thus the agent to act in an intelligent manner in human populated environments. Thus, the proposed framework outlines a proficient system in the construction of human conceivable environment representations, which has been successfully assessed on real-world scenarios, proving its ability to provide a consistent solution to the emerging problem of the human-robot cohabitation.}

Such environments are the products of human preferences, activity and thought; they are imbued with semantic meaning. In this paper we investigate qualitative spatial relations with the aim of both perceiving those semantics, and of using semantics to perceive. More specifically, in this paper we introduce general perceptual measures for two common topological spatial relations, “on” and “in”, that allow a robot to evaluate object configurations, possible or actual, in terms of those relations. We also show how these spatial relations can be used as a way of guiding visual object search. We do this by providing a principled approach for indirect search in which the robot can make use of known or assumed spatial relations between objects, significantly increasing the efficiency of search by first looking for an intermediate object that is easier to find. We explain our design, implementation and experimental setup and provide extensive experimental results to back up our thesis.}

The significance of the approach lies in developing a new framework that consists of the new modeling of high-level robot actions and then their integration with common-sense knowledge in order to support a robotic task planner. This framework will enable interactions between the task planner and the semantic knowledge base directly. By using common-sense domain knowledge, the task planner will take into consideration the properties and relations of objects and places in its environment, before creating semantically related actions that will represent a plan. This plan will accomplish the user order. The robot task planner will use the available domain knowledge to check the next related actions to the current one and the action's conditions met will be chosen. Then the robot will use the immediately available knowledge information to check whether the plan outcomes are met or violated.}

The scientific paradox represents the contradictory description of the same reality within different scientific disciplines. Under the original Natural-Constructive Cognitive Architecture this paradox can be reproduced as impossibility to merge different representations of the same object. It is shown that this architecture involves, in particular, the high-level symbolic information that could be associated with concept of “scientific discipline”. The scientific paradox is treated as impossibility to integrate (merge) the symbols referring to different scientific disciplines. It is shown that the paradox could be resolved within the proposed architecture by decomposition of the high-level symbols down to low-level of corresponding raw mages, with subsequent revision of the object’s memorization procedure. One of the main distinctive features of the proposed architecture is the raw-image processor responsible for recording all the information on the presented object including even rare, seemingly inessential one, which correspond to rather weak connections between involved (halo) neurons. This processor could be associated with human sub-consciousness. The role of weak connections in resolution of paradox and scientific discovery (chef-d’oeuvre) is discussed.}

Moreover, they are interesting for general audiences and industries. Currently, many major research areas in artificial intelligence and robotics are organizing multiple-year competitions that are typically associated with scientific conferences. One important aspect of such competitions is that they are organized for many years. This introduces a temporal evolution that is interesting to analyze. However, the problem of evaluating a competition over many years remains unaddressed. We believe that this issue is critical to properly fuel changes over the years and measure the results of these decisions. Therefore, this article focuses on the analysis and the results of evolving competitions. In this article, we present the RoboCup@Home competition, which is the largest worldwide competition for domestic service robots, and evaluate its progress over the past seven years. We show how the definition of a proper scoring system allows for desired functionalities to be related to tasks and how the resulting analysis fuels subsequent changes to achieve general and robust solutions implemented by the teams. Our results show not only the steadily increasing complexity of the tasks that RoboCup@Home robots can solve but also the increased performance for all of the functionalities addressed in the competition. We believe that the methodology used in RoboCup@Home for evaluating competition advances and for stimulating changes can be applied and extended to other robotic competitions as well as to multi-year research projects involving Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.}

abstract = {Spawned by fast paced progress in marine science and technology, the past two decades have witnessed growing interest in ocean exploration and exploitation for scientific and commercial purposes, the development of technological products for the maritime and offshore industries, and a host of other activities in which the marine environment takes center stage. In this context, marine robotics has steadily emerged as a key enabling technology for the execution of increasingly complex and challenging missions at sea. Intensive research and development in this field have led to major advances and shown unequivocally the effectiveness and reliability of marine robotics solutions in several domains. This progress goes hand in hand with the availability of increasingly sophisticated acoustic networks for multiple, cooperative missions involving surface and underwater robots. At the root of this trend is the fruitful dialogue between robotic systems developers and end-users with the capacity to convert general mission objectives into functional and technical specifications that serve as application-driven requirements for engineering development. The result is the tremendous progress observed in the consolidated methodologies and procedures adopted and the consequent impact on science, industry, and the society at large. In spite of the progress in the area, however many challenges must still be faced and novel applications will continue to set further requirements for future generations of marine robots and their enabling systems. The time is therefore appropriate to overview recent trends in the field of marine robotics and assess their impact on several important application domains. With these objectives in mind, in the present paper we highlight key technological achievements in the field, analyze some of the shortcomings encountered, and indicate specific issues that warrant further research and development effort. To this end, we review a number of highly representative projects in the field, with due account for the theoretical frameworks upon which technological developments build upon. Finally, the paper concludes with an outlook on the future of marine robotics, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, and describes recently initiated projects that hold promise for the development of advanced tools and systems for ocean exploration and exploitation.}

The objective of our research is to investigate the concepts and implementations of reasoning processes for S-CPSs, and more specifically, the frameworks proposed for the fuzzy front end of their reasoning mechanisms. The objectives of the paper are: (i) to analyze the framework concepts and implementations of CPS, (ii) to review the literature concerning system-level reasoning and its enablers from the points of view of the processed knowledge, building awareness, reasoning mechanisms, decision making, and adaptation. Our findings are: (i) awareness and adaptation behaviors are considered as system-level smartness of S-CPSs that are not achieved by traditional design approaches; (ii) model-based and composability approaches insufficiently support the development of reasoning mechanisms for S-CPSs; (iii) frameworks for development of reasoning in S-CPS should support compositional design. Based on the conclusions above, we argue that coping with the challenges of compositionality requires both software-level integration and holistic fusion of knowledge by means of semantic transformations. This entails the need for a multi aspect framework that is able to capture at least conceptual, functional, architectural, informational, interoperation, and behavioral aspects. It needs further investigation if a compositionality enabling framework should appear in the form of a meta-framework (abstract) or in the form of a semantically integrated (concrete) framework.}

The association algorithm is used to conduct full-factor primary mining on the fire-related factors in the data warehouse, and the common-sense accident attributes in the association rules are extracted. Then use the K-means clustering algorithm, where the cluster center is the relevant attribute in the fire accident record, and perform the second combined clustering of the accident elements to achieve in-depth information mining of all factors of the fire accident. Experimental results show that the improved full-factor deep information mining algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively filter 31.6% of meaningless mining results compared to the traditional single mining algorithm. It shows that the algorithm in this paper can more accurately dig out the relationship between data, and can provide more effective decision support for fire management and other work.}

The objective of cognitive processing is to replicate the human thought processes in a computerized model. Employing self-learning algorithms that use data mining, pattern recognition, and natural language processing concerning this specific subject in which the computer can mimic the human brain function. CC makes a new class of glitches computable. The problem can address the complex situations characterized by vagueness as well as doubt. The diverse, ample-data, and frequently changing circumstances, data manage to shift continuously, moreover it is contradictory also. Another objective of CC is to evaluate users’ needs through learning and reframing their goals and objectives. Following the diversity of user’s interpretation of problems, the CC system presents the reorganization of types of data and sways meaning and analysis. When arriving at a conclusion the CC system usually relies on considering contradictory proof and proposing a solution which is “best” more than precisely “right.” The systems with CC ability create quantifiable situations. Machines with cognitive systems recognize as well as excerpt factor characteristics for example location, time, history, work, or description to portray the data set suitable for a person or for a relying implementation involved in a particular method at an exact schedule and location. These systems reframe the scenery involving the association of individuals and their progressively all-encompassing digital environment. This has been shown to play a larger role as the mentor or assistant for the user, similarly they may behave digitally independent for resolving various problems.}

This paper focuses on one of the greatest challenges in service planning that is aimed at accomplishing the service tasks by generating appropriate object sequences to guide the robot on searching the corresponding target objects efficiently and reasonably. A well-structured knowledge-based framework of object search is proposed in our approach as well as taking into account the multi-domain knowledge of applying object, scene, and service in design. In order to improve the searching efficiency and reasonability, an ontology-based hierarchical and interrelated knowledge structure is formed to support the implementation of complicated service planning with either single or multiple tasks. The proposed framework is tested by comprehensive experiments, and the performance is evaluated with other mainstream methods in both simulation and real-world environments. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying this knowledge-based framework to efficient object searching aspect in service planning.}

In this situation, we attempt to realize context-awareness for home robot while previous robot research focused on image processing, control and low-level context recognition. This paper uses probabilistic modeling for service robots to provide users with high-level context-aware services required in home environment, and proposes a systematic modeling approach for modeling a number of Bayesian networks. The proposed approach supplements uncertain sensor input using Bayesian network modeling and enhances the efficiency in modeling and reasoning processes using modular design based on domain knowledge. We verify the proposed method is useful as measuring the performance of context-aware module and conducting subjective test.}

abstract = {Ambient intelligence, ubiquitous and networked robots, and cloud robotics are new research hot topics that have started to gain popularity among the robotics community. They enable robots to acquire richer functionalities and open the way for the composition of a variety of robotic services with three functions: semantic perception, reasoning and actuation. Ubiquitous robots (ubirobots) overcome the limitations of stand-alone robots by integrating them with web services and ambient intelligence technologies. The overlap that exists now between ubirobots and ambient intelligence makes their integration worthwhile. It targets to create a hybrid physical–digital space rich with a myriad of proactive intelligent services that enhance the quality and the way of our living and working. Furthermore, the emergence of cloud computing initiates the massive use of a new generation of ubirobots that enrich their cognitive capabilities and share their knowledge by connecting themselves to cloud infrastructures. The future of ubirobots will certainly be open to an unlimited space of applications such as physical and virtual companions assisting people in their daily living, ubirobots that are able to co-work alongside people and cooperate with them in the same environment, and physical and virtual autonomic guards that are able to protect people, monitor their security and safety, and rescue them in indoor and outdoor spaces. This paper introduces the recent challenges and future trends on these topics.}

The distinctive features of human intelligence are high-level cognition and control in various interactions with the world including the self, which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages. The striking consensus that emerges from these studies is that probabilistic descriptions of learning and inference are powerful and effective ways to create human-like artificial intelligent machines and to understand intelligence in the context of how humans interact with their world.}

After making astounding progress in language learning in the recent decade, AI systems, however, seem to approach the ceiling that does not reflect important aspects of human communicative capacities. Unlike human learners, communicative AI systems often fail to systematically generalize to new data, suffer from sample inefficiency, fail to capture common-sense semantic knowledge, and do not translate to real-world communicative situations. Cognitive Science offers several insights on how AI could move forward from this point. This paper aims to: (1) suggest that the dominant cognitively-inspired AI directions, based on nativist and symbolic paradigms, lack necessary substantiation and concreteness to guide progress in modern AI, and (2) articulate an alternative, “grounded”, perspective on AI advancement, inspired by Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive Cognition (4E) research. I review results on 4E research lines in Cognitive Science to distinguish the main aspects of naturalistic learning conditions that play causal roles for human language development. I then use this analysis to propose a list of concrete, implementable components for building “grounded” linguistic intelligence. These components include embodying machines in a perception–action cycle, equipping agents with active exploration mechanisms so they can build their own curriculum, allowing agents to gradually develop motor abilities to promote piecemeal language development, and endowing the agents with adaptive feedback from their physical and social environment. I hope that these ideas can direct AI research towards building machines that develop human-like language abilities through their experiences with the world.}

Briefly put, partial Image 2-consistency ensures that each base relation of each of the constraints of a qualitative constraint network can define a singleton relation in its corresponding partially weakly path-consistent, or partially ⋄-consistent for short, subnetwork. In this paper, we propose a stronger local consistency that couples Image 2-consistency with the idea of collectively deleting certain unfeasible base relations by exploiting singleton checks. We then propose an algorithm for enforcing this new consistency and a lazy variant of that algorithm for approximating the new consistency that, given a qualitative constraint network, both outperform the respective algorithm for enforcing partial Image 3-consistency in that network. With respect to the lazy algorithmic variant in particular, we show that it runs up to 5 times faster than our original exhaustive algorithm whilst exhibiting very similar pruning capability. We formally prove certain properties of our new local consistency and our algorithms, and motivate their usefulness through demonstrative examples and a thorough experimental evaluation with random qualitative constraint networks of the Interval Algebra and the Region Connection Calculus from the phase transition region of two different generation models. Finally, we provide evidence of the crucial role of the new consistency in tackling the minimal labeling problem of a qualitative constraint network, which is the problem of finding the strongest implied constraints of that network.}

Given the current growth and innovation in the research communities concerned with the topics of robot navigation, human–robot-interaction and human activity recognition, it seems like this might soon change. Robots are increasingly easy to obtain and use and the acceptance of them in general is growing. However, the design of a socially compliant robot that can function as a companion needs to take various areas of research into account.

Specifically, we propose heuristics that dynamically associate a weight with a relation in the branching decisions that occur during backtracking search, based on the count of local models that the relation is involved with in a given QCN. Experimental results with a random and a structured dataset of QCNs of Interval Algebra show that it is possible to achieve up to 5 times better performance for structured instances, whilst maintaining non-negligible gains of around 20% for random ones. Finally, we show that these results may be notably improved via a selection protocol algorithm that synthesizes the involved heuristics into an overall better performing meta-heuristic in the phase transition.}

Current capabilities of robotic platforms in understanding the surrounding environment and the assigned tasks are limited, despite the recent progress in robotic perception. Moreover, novel improvements in human–robot interaction support the view that robots should be regarded as intelligent agents that can request the help of the user to improve their knowledge and performance. In this paper, we present a novel approach to semantic mapping. Instead of requiring our robots to autonomously learn every possible aspect of the environment, we propose a shift in perspective, allowing non-expert users to shape robot knowledge through human–robot interaction. Thus, we present a fully operational prototype system that is able to incrementally and on-line build a rich and specific representation of the environment. Such a novel representation combines the metric information needed for navigation tasks with the symbolic information that conveys meaning to the elements of the environment and the objects therein. Thanks to such a representation, we are able to exploit multiple AI techniques to solve spatial referring expressions and support task execution. The proposed approach has been experimentally validated on different kinds of environments, by several users, and on multiple robotic platforms.}

However, despite this increasing trend there has been no general account of all these works in terms of how they relate to each other and what their real achievements are. Also, there is poor understanding about what intelligence tests measure in machines, whether they are useful to evaluate AI systems, whether they are really challenging problems, and whether they are useful to understand (human) intelligence. In this paper, we provide some insight on these issues, in the form of nine specific questions, by giving a comprehensive account of about thirty computer models, from the 1960s to nowadays, and their relationships, focussing on the range of intelligence test tasks they address, the purpose of the models, how general or specialised these models are, the AI techniques they use in each case, their comparison with human performance, and their evaluation of item difficulty. As a conclusion, these tests and the computer models attempting them show that AI is still lacking general techniques to deal with a variety of problems at the same time. Nonetheless, a renewed attention on these problems and a more careful understanding of what intelligence tests offer for AI may help build new bridges between psychometrics, cognitive science, and AI; and may motivate new kinds of problem repositories.}

abstract = {This paper discusses basic notions underlying fuzzy sets, especially gradualness, uncertainty, vagueness and bipolarity, in order to clarify the significance of using fuzzy sets in practice. Starting with the idea that a fuzzy set may represent either a precise gradual composite entity or an epistemic construction refereeing to an ill-known object, it is shown that each of this view suggests a different use of fuzzy sets. Then, it is argued that the usual phrase fuzzy number is ambiguous as it induces some confusion between gradual extensions of real numbers and gradual extensions of interval calculations. The distinction between degrees of truth that are compositional and degrees of belief that cannot be so is recalled. The truth-functional calculi of various extensions of fuzzy sets, motivated by the desire to handle ill-known membership grades, are shown to be of limited significance for handling this kind of uncertainty. Finally, the idea of a separate handling of membership and non-membership grades put forward by Atanassov is cast in the setting of reasoning about bipolar information. This intuition is different from the representation of ill-known membership functions and leads to combination rules differing from the ones proposed for handling uncertainty about membership grades.}
