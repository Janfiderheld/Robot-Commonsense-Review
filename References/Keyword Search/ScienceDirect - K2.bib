abstract = {The past thirty years have witnessed the spread of rankings, ratings and league tables as governance technologies which aim to regulate the provision of public goods by means of market pressures. This paper examines the process of company analysis underlying the production of a ranking known as the Access to Medicine Index. We conceptualize the Index as a “regulatory ranking” with the explicit mission of addressing a perceived regulatory gap and market failure: the lack of access to medicine in the Global South. The Index, which ranks the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with regards to their access to medicine policies and practices, aspires to help address the problem of access to medicine through stakeholder consultation, transparency and competition. This study unbundles the epistemic work underlying the performance measurement process leading to the creation of the Index. We trace how the goal of stakeholder consensus, the need to project objectivity and the aspiration to govern through competition shape analysts' epistemic work. We discuss how through notions such as “the good distribution” and “aspirational indicators”, performance measurement and ranking become entangled in a “politics of variability” whereby company data need to be variably interpreted in order to optimise the possibilities of intervening in companies through competitive pressures, while at the same time complying with the imperatives to remain in the space of perceived stakeholder consensus and to provide a faithful representation of companies performance to inform public debates. We reflect on the challenges posed by these analysis processes for the regulatory aspirations of the ranking.}

Theoretically, it is common sense that existing service capabilities cannot easily be converted into organizational capabilities for pay-per-use services. Based on multiple case studies, the present article narrows down the existing empirical and theoretical gaps through an inductive research approach. Our findings make the following contributions to the field of services in product-oriented companies and to the servitization literature. We describe the organizational capabilities necessary for pay-per-use services (e.g., financing such services, aligning costs with equipment usage, and collaborating with customers). We reveal that companies should convert these capabilities into three core competencies (strategizing pay-per-use services, utilizing technologies for pay-per-use services, and de-risking pay-per-use services), in order to achieve competitive advantages.}

For datacentres, this finance backs commoditised packages consisting of land with pre-approved planning permission; access to low-cost, reliable, renewable power; and a range of built infrastructure and computing options. Seeking to benefit from the development of monetised, dependent, regional Information Technology ecosystems, states assist with regulatory adjustments and municipalities with supportive land use zoning. Given the deeply entrained and multifaceted nature of the sector, we use our cases to highlight relationships between datacentre financing, spatial planning and infrastructure development in the two countries and also the ways in which the sector may take differing development trajectories. Overall, we build on the developing literature that is revealing the material realities of ‘the cloud’.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have recently been developed to support mental health professionals, primarily psychiatrists and clinicians, with decision-making based on patients' historical data (e.g., clinical history, behavioural data, social media use, etc.). There is a significant need to cope with fundamental mental health issues in children that can lead to complicated, if not treated at an early stage. Hence, in this paper, Deep Learning assisted Integrated Prediction Model (DLIPM) has been proposed to early forecast and diagnose children's mental illness. In the suggested model, convolutional neural networks (CNN) is first constructed to learn deep-learned patient behavioural data features. By embedding semantic mathematical methods of behaviour or brain dynamic forces into a statistical deep learning framework, insights into disruption, effective classification, and forecast can be achieved. The simulation analysis shows that the proposed model enhances sensitivity rate of 97.9%, specificity rate of 96.7%, recall ratio of 95.6%, the precision ratio of 90.1% of F-measure rate of 95.6%, and less error rate of 9.2% than other existing methods.}

The objective of this study was to measure changes in trainees’ cognitive and behavioral states as they progressed in a robotic surgeon training curriculum at a medical institution. Seven surgical trainees in urology who had no formal robotic training experience participated in the simulation curriculum. They performed 12 robotic skills exercises with varying levels of difficulty repetitively in separate sessions. EEG (electroencephalogram) activity and eye movements were measured throughout to calculate three metrics: engagement index (indicator of task engagement), pupil diameter (indicator of mental workload) and gaze entropy (indicator of randomness in gaze pattern). Performance scores (completion of task goals) and mental workload ratings (NASA-Task Load Index) were collected after each exercise. Changes in performance scores between training sessions were calculated. Analysis of variance, repeated measures correlation, and machine learning classification were used to diagnose how cognitive and behavioral states associate with performance increases or decreases between sessions. The changes in performance were correlated with changes in engagement index (rrm=−.25,p<.001) and gaze entropy (rrm=−.37,p<.001). Changes in cognitive and behavioral states were able to predict training outcomes with 72.5% accuracy. Findings suggest that cognitive and behavioral metrics correlate with changes in performance between sessions. These measures can complement current feedback tools used by medical educators and learners for skills assessment in robotic surgery training.}

In design, when the evaluation often lies in the performance of the artefact, an increase in the technical and functional requirements of the artefact drive the requirement for a more abstract and integrated use of the knowledge recruited.}

Analyzing the total costs of automation solutions, engineering efforts account for the largest share. However, potentials for time and cost savings as well as quality improvements by reusing existing engineering knowledge are usually not exploited in industrial practice. In this context, knowledge-based configurators are the most popular expert systems and present an opportunity to automate the creation of customer-specific automation solutions. Especially for efficient knowledge reuse, constraint-based configurators seem suitable. However, existing methods for developing configurators focus on product configurators rather than on knowledge-based engineering configurators (KBEC). In addition, the necessary knowledge acquisition (KA) is still one of the major challenges in developing KBECs. Open fields of action include the definition of the optimal functional scope as well as the identification, prioritization, and selection of suitable knowledge sources. Another prerequisite represents the transparency of existing engineering processes and interests of all affected stakeholders. Therefore, this paper introduces a six-step approach enabling the development of use-oriented KBECs with the minimum required functional scope to reduce efforts for KA and thus overall development costs. Finally, the strategic approach is validated using the example of a KBEC for the concept planning of robot-based automation solutions.}

In this paper, we propose an adaptive scenario discovery framework for counting crowds with varying densities. The framework is structured with two parallel pathways that are trained to represent different crowd densities and present in the proper geometric configuration using different sizes of the receptive field. A third adaption branch is designed to adaptively recalibrate the pathway-wise responses by discovering and modeling the dynamic scenarios implicitly. We conduct experiments using the adaptive scenario discovery framework on five challenging crowd counting datasets and demonstrate its superiority in terms of effectiveness and efficiency over previous approaches.}

The study on collective behaviors in social networks is a key to analyze community dynamics and network functionalities. Hence, it is significant and necessary to accurately extract and analyze these collective behaviors. At present, the semantic behaviors of any individual in semantic social networks can be extracted conveniently. However, how to automatically extract collective semantic behaviors, to a large scale, in social networks is still an open question. Our proposed collective semantic behavior extraction process works as follows: Firstly, as for the popular semantic social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and QQ, it is convenient to extract semantic behaviors from any semantic information. Secondly, as similar behaviors will form a community spontaneously, the communities with similar extracted semantic behaviors can be determined with DeepWalk. Hence, as for a determined community, our proposed collective semantic behavior extraction approach can properly extract the collective semantic behaviors in social networks. The experimental results of our proposed approach executed on real semantic information show that our proposed approach can automatically extract collective semantic behaviors accurately.}

One of the knowledge sources is the mental models of experts working in specific fields of construction engineering. Based on the knowledge acquisition sessions that have been completed, it can be concluded that only a certain part of the knowledge contained in mental models has been acquired. In order to ensure more completeness of the knowledge and explain the mechanism of inference, the KBANN (Knowledge Based Artificial Neural Network) algorithm was used, which enables extracting rules that are not a part of the original state of knowledge using trained neural networks.

The a priori probabilities are frequently provided nowadays by the manufacturers of these systems. In turn, the probabilities of conditional observations are, as a rule, not available. The question arises as to whether and under what conditions it is possible to substitute conditional probabilities with some aggregate obtainable on the grounds of fuzzy logic. This article responds to this question by proposing a hybrid approach with novelty characteristics in both theoretical and practical terms. In the initial phase of the deliberations, it was concluded that the fundamental difference between Bayesian and fuzzy approaches is that the fuzzy approach considers the uncertainty and lack of precision of observations but overlooks the frequency of observations, and the opposite is true of the Bayesian approach. It therefore seems reasonable to seek the hybridization of both methods so that the Bayesian approach carrying the information regarding the subjective probabilities of faults can be applied in practice. To this end, it has been shown that the probability of a conditional observation can be estimated by calculating the degree of truth of the premise for that observation in the state-specific fuzzy rule. The reminder is devoted to presenting numerical and simulation examples illustrating and verifying the proposed approach.}

To ensure potential affordances are leveraged and potential limitations and risks are identified and addressed, a structured approach for identifying opportunities and challenges for people, plant and procedures could be beneficial. A literature review revealed that for process safety management there is a gap associated with exploring the utility of frameworks that facilitate a structured approach for thinking about data, information, knowledge and wisdom from a people, plant and procedures perspective. This article explores work done to answer the research question – Can the data-information-knowledge-wisdom-action (DIKWA) cycle and people-plant-procedures (P3) model help identify important considerations associated with ‘Big Data’ applications within the process industries especially in terms of process safety management? We apply these frameworks to an industry case study on high temperature hydrogen attack and find that it revealed insights into options for and affordances and limitations associated with adopting ‘Big Data’ technology and tools. The implications of these insights for process safety management are discussed then recommendations are made about future research which includes the need to use this work to inform the development of a useful and usable knowledge processing model for process safety applications.}

abstract = {The world is moving extremely fast towards creating a superintelligence that will go far beyond human capabilities. Proper use of this superintelligence in enterprises will result in developing conditions in which their potential is fully exploited. In the context of the above, research has been undertaken to recognize the level of knowledge maturity in the domain of IT tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm. In other words, it is about recognizing whether the enterprise knows IT tools supporting management operating on the basis of the artificial intelligence algorithm. It was assumed that in the fourth generation industry era such tools should be implemented by Polish manufacturers operating in the agricultural machinery sector. To assess the level of business knowledge of IT tools based on AI algorithms maturity the self-evaluation questionnaire was developed and the research was conducted among manufacturers of parts, subassemblies and ready-made agricultural machines.}

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate how student teachers benefit from authentic researcher experiences as part of their pre-service education. The data were collected by electronic questionnaires (n = 287) at two Finnish Universities. Teacher education programs guided student teachers to use and conduct research in the teaching profession. The results indicate that student teachers value research experiences. Research studies promoted professional competences and supported students' growth toward evidence-based practice and 21st century skills. Active learning experiences reinforced this positive effect. The implementation of research studies, quality of supervisors and integration with other studies were crucial.}

abstract = {Using intelligent expert systems is a necessity for improving the situation of organizations. Since the process of identifying strategy in a strategic plan is time-consuming and costly, the role of expert systems in strategic planning is considerable. Managers utilize expert system to maintain and disseminate knowledge, training, and competition in the organization. Complicated expert system with long codes, practicality is not developable because of code complexity, but structural properties of the namespace and functions in C++ with using the object, solve this complexity and all codes are accessible without knowing based codes. In this paper using object orientation properties of C++, the expert can access, develop the system in the inference engine, practically without knowing based system code. According to the presented algorithm, the expert system designs a simple system for strategic planning in two steps, first for discerning the system state, second for prioritizing the indicators.}
