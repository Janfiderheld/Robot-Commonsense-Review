abstract={Opportunity and resources are the two key elements of entrepreneurship, and they are inseparable. Scholars have paid more attention to integrating opportunities and resources for new ventures. At the same time, the academic community has widely recognized the important role of ‘dynamic capability’ in the survival and development of enterprises. However, few studies have explored the relationship between the integration of opportunity resources and dynamic capabilities of new ventures in essence and have not revealed the mechanism of big data analysis capability supported by artificial intelligence (BDAC-AI) in the process of improving the entrepreneurial performance of new ventures. Based on the resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, this paper integrates opportunity resource integration and dynamic capability into a research framework for the first time, constructs a new theoretical model and discusses the impact mechanism of BDAC-AI and opportunity resource integration on entrepreneurial performance. Based on the data of 225 new ventures, this paper finds that (1) both BDAC-AI and opportunity resource integration of new ventures have a positive impact on dynamic capability and dynamic capability has a positive role in promoting entrepreneurial performance; (2) dynamic capability plays an intermediary role in the relationship between BDAC-AI, opportunity resource integration and new venture performance; and (3) BDAC-AI positively regulates opportunity resource integration. However, it has no moderating effect on the mediating effect of dynamic capabilities. The research conclusion has important theoretical significance for the improvement of new ventures' entrepreneurial performance and has important practical significance for the survival and development of new ventures under the background of artificial intelligence. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Potential spiritual impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven Assistive Technologies (AT) for older adults are absent in most ethics conversations. Intelligent Assistive Technology (IAT) is the term used to describe the spectrum of Assistive Technologies that use AI. In this theoretical essay, I begin by introducing examples of AT and IAT for older adults with age-related disabilities. I argue that spirituality is a marginalized value in ethics that must be considered if IAT ethics is to address the whole person. Some of the potential spiritual impacts of IATs will be suggested through engagement with three core spiritual needs. I ask how IAT might impact these three core spiritual needs. This is not meant to be an exhaustive study of the spiritual impacts of AT. Through the engagement of one approach to spiritual needs, this article proposes that IAT ethics issues intersect with the spiritual needs of aging adults and, therefore, that potential spiritual impacts ought to be addressed as part of IAT ethics for older adults. © 2022 by the author.

abstract={Groupware exist, and they contain expertise knowledge (explicit and tacit) that is primarily for solving problems, and it is collected on-the-job through virtual teams; such knowledge should be harvested. A system to acquire on-the-job knowledge of experts from groupware in view of the enrichment of intelligent agents has become one of the important technologies that is very much in demand in the field of knowledge technology, especially in this era of textual data explosion including due to the ever-increasing remote work culture. Before acquiring new knowledge from sentences in groupware into an existing ontology, it is vital to process the groupware discussions to recognise concepts (especially new ones), as well as to find the appropriate mappings between the said concepts and the destination ontology. There are several mapping procedures in the literature, but these have been formulated on the basis of mapping two or more independent ontologies using concept-similarities and it requires a significant amount of computation. With the goal of lowering computational complexities, identification difficulties, and complications of insertion (hooking) of a concept into an existing ontology, this paper proposes: (1) an ontology-based framework with changeable modules to harvest knowledge from groupware discussions; and (2) a facts enrichment approach (FEA) for the identification of new concepts and the insertion/hooking of new concepts from sentences into an existing ontology. This takes into consideration the notions of equality, similarity, and equivalence of concepts. This unique approach can be implemented on any platform of choice using current or newly constructed modules that can be constantly revised with enhanced sophistication or extensions. In general, textual data is taken and analysed in view of the creation of an ontology that can be utilised to power intelligent agents. The complete architecture of the framework is provided and the evaluation of the results reveal that the proposed methodology performs significantly better compared to the universally recommended thresholds as well as the existing works. Our technique shows a notable high improvement on the F1 score that measures precision and recall. In terms of future work, the study recommends the development of algorithms to fully automate the framework as well as for harvesting tacit knowledge from groupware. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={One realm of AI, recommender systems have attracted significant research attention due to concerns about its devastating effects to society’s most vulnerable and marginalised communities. Both media press and academic literature provide compelling evidence that AI-based recommendations help to perpetuate and exacerbate racial and gender biases. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which individuals might question AI-based recommendations when perceived as biased. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigate the effects of espoused national cultural values on AI questionability, by examining how individuals might question AI-based recommendations due to perceived racial or gender bias. Data collected from 387 survey respondents in the United States indicate that individuals with espoused national cultural values associated to collectivism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance are more likely to question biased AI-based recommendations. This study advances understanding of how cultural values affect AI questionability due to perceived bias and it contributes to current academic discourse about the need to hold AI accountable. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The exchange of construction-related data over the Web via Semantic Web Technologies is gaining interest in current research. However, most research focuses on non-geometric data, neglecting the description of geometry. While several methods to include geometry descriptions into a Semantic Web context exist, no uniform approach or general recommendation exists for the endeavour of describing building components in their entirety – including geometric descriptions –, leading to an increased suspension in applying Semantic Web Technologies in the construction domain. To therefore ease the description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits individual use cases. The identified approaches vary in their depth of the geometry description's integration into the Semantic Web and are subsequently studied regarding their overall aptness and characteristics in consideration of their application for future industry and research projects. In respect of the ongoing research in the field of the application of Semantic Web Technologies, not only in the construction domain, this article poses as an important foundation by giving a clear overview of existing implementations and relevant open research questions. Having this overview, the suspense for adapting to Semantic Web methods for describing geometries can be overcome by users more easily, while software developers can start to connect their clients' use cases to suitable approaches and related implementations to represent geometry in a Semantic Web context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Information systems for un-regimented domains such as museums, art and book collections, face representational and usability challenges that surpass the demands of traditional information systems for regimented domains. While the former require complex conceptual models supporting a set of dynamic and evolving qualitative properties of a small number of objects, the latter focus on the quantitative aspects of a possibly very large number of objects but with a relatively small and stable set of properties. In this paper we study the use of a non-monotonic knowledge-base system for the development of information systems for un-regimented domains. We discuss the ontological assumptions of the formalism, its structure and its inferential mechanisms through a simple example. Then we present an information system for a highly un-regimented domain in the digital humanities with promising results. The present study shows that the so-called extensible, flexible, dynamic or evolving information systems need the expressive power of non-monotonic knowledge-base systems, and that such phenomena should be addressed explicitly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Smart Health technologies (s-Health technologies) are being developed to support people with dementia (PwD) and their informal caregivers at home, to improve care and reduce the levels of burden and stress they experience. However, although s-Health technologies have the potential to facilitate this, the factors influencing a successful implementation in this population are still unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to review existing literature to explore the factors influencing PwD and their informal caregivers' adoption of s-Health technologies for home care. Methods: Following the Arksey and O'Malley methodology, this study is a scoping review providing a narrative description of the scientific literature on factors influencing s-Health technology adoption for PwD and their informal caregivers. A search was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane library, the IEEE library, and Scopus. Publications screening was conducted by 2 researchers based on inclusion criteria, and full-text analysis was then conducted by 1 researcher. The included articles were thematically analyzed by 2 researchers to gain an insight into factors influencing adoption that PwD and their informal caregivers have to encounter when using s-Health technologies. Relevant information was identified and coded. Codes were later discussed between the researchers for developing and modifying them and for achieving a consensus, and the researchers organized the codes into broader themes. Results: Emerging themes were built in a way that said something specific and meaningful about the research question, creating a list of factors influencing the adoption of s-Health technologies for PwD and their informal caregivers, including attitudinal aspects, ethical issues, technology-related challenges, condition-related challenges, and identified gaps. A design framework was created as a guide for future research and innovation in the area of s-Health technologies for PwD and their informal caregivers: DemDesCon for s-Health Technologies. DemDesCon for s-Health Technologies addresses 4 domains to consider for the design and development of s-Health technologies for this population: cognitive decline domain, physical decline domain, social domain, and development domain. Conclusions: Although s-Health technologies have been used in health care scenarios, more work is needed for them to fully achieve their potential for use in dementia care. Researchers, businesses, and public governments need to collaborate to design and implement effective technology solutions for PwD and their informal caregivers, but the lack of clear design guidelines seems to be slowing the process. We believe that the DemDesCon framework will provide them with the guidance and assistance needed for creating meaningful devices for PwD home care and informal caregivers, filling a much-needed space in the present knowledge gap. © Estefanía Guisado-Fernández, Guido Giunti, Laura M Mackey, Catherine Blake, Brian Michael Caulfield.

abstract={MARIO is an assistive robot that has to support a set of knowledge-intensive tasks aimed at increasing autonomy and reducing loneliness in people with dementia and supporting caregivers in their activity to assess patients’ cognitive status. Examples of knowledge-intensive tasks are the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and the delivery of reminiscence therapy. In order to enable these tasks, MARIO features a set of abilities implemented by pluggable software applications. MARIO’s abilities contribute to and benefit from a common knowledge management framework. For example, the ability associated with the CGA retrieves questions to be posed to the patient from the framework and stores the obtained answers and associated relevant metadata. In this work we presents the MARIO knowledge management software framework, which combines robotics with ontology-based approaches and Semantic Web technologies. It consists of (1) a set of interconnected and modularized ontologies, meant to model all knowledge areas that are relevant for MARIO abilities, and (2) a set of software interfaces that provide high-level access to the ontology network and its associated knowledge base. Finally, we demonstrate how the knowledge management framework supports the applications for CGA and reminiscence therapy, implemented on top of the knowledge base. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

Our prototype system interacts with human workers and machine agents via Activity Streams and a speech synthesis interface, and we have shown that its SPIN reasoning engine can scale to scenarios that incorporate complex products and many agents. The current system state and action logs of the agents and products are easily observable using a dashboard interface. The semantic models were evaluated by five experts in workplace safety and process engineering who expressed confidence about using, maintaining, and even extending the models themselves after only negligible training, a crucial factor for the real-world adoption of such systems. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In this paper we are concerned with developing information extraction models that support the extraction of common sense knowledge from a combination of unstructured and semi-structured datasets. Our motivation is to extract manipulation-relevant knowledge that can support robots' action planning. We frame the task as a relation extraction task and, as proof-of-concept, validate our method on the task of extracting two types of relations: locative and instrumental relations. The locative relation relates objects to the prototypical places where the given object is found or stored. The second instrumental relation relates objects to their prototypical purpose of use. While we extract these relations from text, our goal is not to extract specific textual mentions, but rather, given an object as input, extract a ranked list of locations and uses ranked by 'prototypicality'. We use distributional methods in embedding space, relying on the well-known skip-gram model to embed words into a low-dimensional distributional space, using cosine similarity to rank the various candidates. In addition, we also present experiments that rely on the vector space model NASARI, which compute embeddings for disambiguated concepts and are thus semantically aware. While this distributional approach has been published before, we extend our framework by additional methods relying on neural networks that learn a score to judge whether a given candidate pair actually expresses a desired relation. The network thus learns a scoring function using a supervised approach. While we use a ranking-based evaluation, the supervised model is trained using a binary classification task. The resulting score from the neural network and the cosine similarity in the case of the distributional approach are both used to compute a ranking. We compare the different approaches and parameterizations thereof on the task of extracting the above mentioned relations. We show that the distributional similarity approach performs very well on the task. The best performing parameterization achieves an NDCG of 0.913, a Precision@1 of 0.400 and a Precision@3 of 0.423. The performance of the supervised learning approach, in spite of having being trained on positive and negative examples of the relation in question, is not as good as expected and achieves an NCDG of 0.908, a Precision@1 of 0.454 and a Precision@3 of 0.387, respectively. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Assembly cells run by intelligent robotic agents promise highly flexible product customization without the cost implication product individualization has nowadays. One of the main questions an assembly robot has to answer is which sequence of manipulation actions it should perform to create an assembled product from scattered pieces available. We propose a novel approach to assembly planning that employs Description Logics (DL) to describe what an assembled product should look like, and to plan the next action according to faulty and missing assertions in the robot's beliefs about an ongoing assembly task. To this end we extend the KnowRob knowledge base with representations and inference rules that enable robots to reason about incomplete assemblies. We show that our approach performs well for large batches of assembly pieces available, as well as for varying structural complexity of assembled products. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

abstract={With recent technological advances, robotic agents are increasingly capable of performing ever more sophisticated manipulation tasks. Perceptual capabilities of these robots need to be able to adapt to the wide variety of tasks they are to perform. Remembering what a robot has seen, what the rationale was behind the decisions it took or how it ended up understanding the world as it did, are important questions if we want perception capabilities that can scale towards real-world manipulation. We present a robotic perception system that generates perceptual episodic memories during the execution of a task. To allow easy retrieval of these memories we introduce an object and scene description language that serves as a layer of abstraction between the structure of the perception logs and the semantic interpretation of these. The description language can be used through a query interface to retrieve specific parts of the generated episodic memory. The purpose of the proposed system is two-fold: to enable on-line retrospection and specialized training of perception routines and to enable researchers to interactively explore perception results. © 2017 IEEE.},

This presents an opportunity to share images as part of participatory geographic information systems initiatives similar to OpenStreetMap. We outline a workflow to generate maps from UAV aerial images.

abstract={This study aims at implementing a simple and effective remedial learning system. Based on fuzzy inference, a remedial learning material selection system is proposed for a digital logic course. Two learning concepts of the course have been used in the proposed system: number systems and combinational logic. We conducted an experiment to validate the success of the proposed system where 88 students who studied a computer-related program at a vocational high school in Taiwan participated in the experiment. The participating students came from three different types of classes. The fuzzy expert system determined the numbers of the remedial material units according to the scores of the pre-test. Based on the results of the fuzzy expert system, each student then received personalized remedial learning materials by randomly selecting problem-based learning units from a learning material repository. After reading the remedial learning materials, the students took the post-test. The experimental results reveal that the students made significant progresses after studying the remedial learning materials. Both of high-achieving students and low-achieving students made significant progresses. Moreover, all of the three types of students made significant progresses. Lay description: What is currently known about the subject matter: Remedial learning systems are helpful. Some systems are good for only low-achieving students. The remedial systems are complicated. What their paper adds to this: A fuzzy expert system has been added to produce remedial materials. Automatically select the remedial learning units according to the pre-test. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Our remedial system is good for both high-achieving and low-achieving students. Our remedial system is good for different types of students. Our remedial system is simple and easy-to-implement. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

In this paper we will address three key questions: How to obtain appropriate task descriptions from natural language (NL) instructions, how to choose the control program to perform a task description, and how to recognize and manipulate the objects referred by a task description? We describe an evaluated robotic agent which takes a natural language instruction stating a step of DNA extraction procedure as a starting point. The system is able to transform the textual instruction into an abstract symbolic plan representation. It can reason about the representation and answer queries about what, how, and why it is done. The robot selects the most appropriate control programs and robustly coordinates all manipulations required by the task description. The execution is based on a perception sub-system which is able to locate and recognize the objects and instruments needed in the DNA extraction procedure. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A pressing question when designing intelligent autonomous systems is how to integrate the various subsystems concerned with complementary tasks. Robotic vision must provide task relevant information about the environment and the objects in it to various planning related modules. In most implementations of the traditional Perception-Cognition-Action paradigm these tasks are treated as quasi-independent modules that function as black boxes for each other. Often these subsystems are running in completely different frameworks, with a thin communication interface or middle-ware between them. While each subproblem poses specific requirements that can make fusing them more challenging, perception can benefit tremendously from a tight collaboration with cognition. In the following, a common framework for cognitive perception, based on the principle of unstructured information management (UIM) will be presented, called RoboSherlock. UIM has proven itself to be a powerful paradigm for scaling intelligent information and question answering systems towards real-world complexity. Complexity in UIM is handled by identifying (or hypothesizing) pieces of structured information by applying ensembles of experts for annotating information pieces, and by testing and integrating these isolated annotations into a comprehensive interpretation. RoboSherlock is an open source software framework for unstructured information processing in robot perception that demonstrates the potential of the paradigm for real-world scene perception. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Decision making (DM) is a preferences-driven choice among available actions. Under uncertainty, Savage’s axiomatisation singles out Bayesian DM as the adequate normative framework. It constructs strategies generating the optimal actions, while assuming that the decision maker rationally tries to meet her preferences. Descriptive DM theories have observed numerous deviations of the real DM from normative recommendations. The explanation of decision-makers’ imperfection or non-rationality, possibly followed by rectification, is the focal point of contemporary DM research. This chapter falls into this stream and claims that the neglecting a part of the behaviour of the closed DM loop is the major cause of these deviations. It inspects DM subtasks in which this claim matters and where its consideration may practically help. It deals with: (i) the preference elicitation; (ii) the “non-rationality” caused by the difference of preferences declared and preferences followed; (iii) the choice of proximity measures in knowledge and preferences fusion; (iv) ways to a systematic design of approximate DM; and (v) the control of the deliberation effort spent on a DM task via sequential DM. The extent of the above list indicates that the discussion offers more open questions than answers, however, their consideration is the key element of this chapter. Their presentation is an important chapter’s ingredient. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={We study cooperative navigation for robotic swarms in the context of a general event-servicing scenario. In the scenario, one or more events need to be serviced at specific locations by robots with the required skills. We focus on the question of how the swarm can inform its members about events, and guide robots to event locations. We propose a solution based on delay-tolerant wireless communications: by forwarding navigation information between them, robots cooperatively guide each other towards event locations. Such a collaborative approach leverages on the swarm's intrinsic redundancy, distribution, and mobility. At the same time, the forwarding of navigation messages is the only form of cooperation that is required. This means that the robots are free in terms of their movement and location, and they can be involved in other tasks, unrelated to the navigation of the searching robot. This gives the system a high level of flexibility in terms of application scenarios, and a high degree of robustness with respect to robot failures or unexpected events. We study the algorithm in two different scenarios, both in simulation and on real robots. In the first scenario, a single searching robot needs to find a single target, while all other robots are involved in tasks of their own. In the second scenario, we study collective navigation: all robots of the swarm navigate back and forth between two targets, which is a typical scenario in swarm robotics. We show that in this case, the proposed algorithm gives rise to synergies in robot navigation, and it lets the swarm self-organize into a robust dynamic structure. The emergence of this structure improves navigation efficiency and lets the swarm find shortest paths. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In recent years, information theory has come into the focus of researchers interested in the sensorimotor dynamics of both robots and living beings. One root for these approaches is the idea that living beings are information processing systems and that the optimization of these processes should be an evolutionary advantage. Apart from these more fundamental questions, there is much interest recently in the question how a robot can be equipped with an internal drive for innovation or curiosity that may serve as a drive for an open-ended, self-determined development of the robot. The success of these approaches depends essentially on the choice of a convenient measure for the information. This article studies in some detail the use of the predictive information (PI), also called excess entropy or effective measure complexity, of the sensorimotor process. The PI of a process quantifies the total information of past experience that can be used for predicting future events. However, the application of information theoretic measures in robotics mostly is restricted to the case of a finite, discrete state-action space. This article aims at applying the PI in the dynamical systems approach to robot control. We study linear systems as a first step and derive exact results for the PI together with explicit learning rules for the parameters of the controller. Interestingly, these learning rules are of Hebbian nature and local in the sense that the synaptic update is given by the product of activities available directly at the pertinent synaptic ports. The general findings are exemplified by a number of case studies. In particular, in a two-dimensional system, designed at mimicking embodied systems with latent oscillatory locomotion patterns, it is shown that maximizing the PI means to recognize and amplify the latent modes of the robotic system. This and many other examples show that the learning rules derived from the maximum PI principle are a versatile tool for the self-organization of behavior in complex robotic systems. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the context of robotic assistants in human everyday environments, pick and place tasks are beginning to be competently solved at the technical level. The question of where to place objects or where to pick them up from, among other higher-level reasoning tasks, is therefore gaining practical relevance. In this work, we consider the problem of identifying the organizational structure within an environment, i.e. the problem of determining organizational principles that would allow a robot to infer where to best place a particular, previously unseen object or where to reasonably search for a particular type of object given past observations about the allocation of objects to locations in the environment. This problem can be reasonably formulated as a classification task. We claim that organizational principles are governed by the notion of similarity and provide an empirical analysis of the importance of various features in datasets describing the organizational structure of kitchens. For the aforementioned classification tasks, we compare standard classification methods, reaching average accuracies of at least 79% in all scenarios. We thereby show that, in particular, ontology-based similarity measures are well-suited as highly discriminative features. We demonstrate the use of learned models of organizational principles in a kitchen environment on a real robot system, where the robot identifies a newly acquired item, determines a suitable location and then stores the item accordingly. © 2012 IEEE.},
